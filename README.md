# module-test-import
in this project iam looking at modules and how to organize projects, also iam facing a recent problem that is bothering me, more about it in the files

in this projecz i am trying to solve this problem: i had in a previous project where i wanted to get user information from main to a another folder, lets say folder4.py like in my excample, i first tryd to import all folders to my main file, that workd, but then i packd all in one function and wanted to get it back to my 4 th folder i got an error that python didnt found the main folder.

i tryd to document everything for you, maybe that helps a bit.

btw, sorry for my english, it could be that i have some mistakes in my writing.
